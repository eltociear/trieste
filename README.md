## What does Trieste do?

Trieste (pronounced tree-est) is a Bayesian optimization toolbox built on [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). Trieste is named after the bathyscaphe Trieste, the first vehicle to take a crew to Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, the lowest point on the Earthâ€™s surface: the literal global minimum.


## Getting started




In the [Documentation](https://secondmind-labs.github.io/trieste/), we have multiple [Tutorials](https://secondmind-labs.github.io/trieste/tutorials.html) showing the basic functionality of the toolbox, a [benchmark implementation](https://secondmind-labs.github.io/trieste/notebooks/benchmarks.html) and a comprehensive [API reference](https://secondmind-labs.github.io/trieste/autoapi/gpflux/index.html).


Trieste has a [documentation site](https://secondmind-labs.github.io/trieste) with tutorials on how to use the library, and an API reference. You can also run the tutorials interactively. They can be found in the notebooks directory, and are written as Python scripts for running with Jupytext. To run them, first install trieste from sources as above, then install additional 


## Installation
